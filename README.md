#Algorithmic Sorting Techniques

This repository is a collection of various sorting algorithms, each implemented in different programming languages. These sorting algorithms are a cornerstone of computer science, and gaining a deep understanding of them can enhance your coding efficiency and problem-solving capabilities.

The repository includes the following sorting techniques:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- Shell Sort
- Counting Sort

Each of these algorithms has its own advantages and disadvantages, and is best suited to different types of problems and data sets. By understanding these nuances, you can make an informed decision about which algorithm to use in a given situation.

In each subdirectory, you'll find the code implementing the algorithm, along with a README file that provides an explanation of the algorithm, its time complexity, and how to use it.

Feel free to dive in, learn, and contribute!

GitHub Copilot: # Bubble Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a C implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs bubble sort on an integer array. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `i` and `j`: Loop counters.
- `temp`: A temporary variable used for swapping elements.
- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.

## Usage

To use this program, compile it with a C compiler and run the resulting executable. The program expects input in the form of an integer array.

- Implement user-friendly input and output methods.

GitHub Copilot: # Insertion Sort List

This is a C program that implements the insertion sort algorithm on a doubly linked list.

## Code Overview

The code excerpt provided is a part of the insertion sort function. It checks if the current node's value is less than the previous node's value. If it is, it swaps the nodes and continues this process until the list is sorted.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `newtemp`: A temporary pointer used to traverse the list.
- `current`: Points to the current node being compared.
- `prev`: Points to the node before the current node.
- `prev_prev`: Points to the node before the `prev` node.
- `next`: Points to the node after the current node.

## Usage

To use this program, compile it with a C compiler and run the resulting executable. The program expects input in the form of a doubly linked list.

GitHub Copilot: # Selection Sort Algorithm

This repository includes a C implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.

## Overview of the Code

The provided code is a function that performs selection sort on an integer array. Selection sort is a simple, in-place sorting algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the ordering) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region. This process continues until the unsorted region becomes empty and the sorted region covers the entire input.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `i` and `j`: Loop counters.
- `small`: Index of the smallest element in the unsorted region.
- `temp`: A temporary variable used for swapping elements.
- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.

## Next Steps

- Enhance the efficiency of the sorting algorithm.
- Incorporate error handling for edge cases.
- Develop user-friendly input and output methods.

GitHub Copilot: # Bubble Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a C implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs bubble sort on an integer array. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `i` and `j`: Loop counters.
- `temp`: A temporary variable used for swapping elements.
- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.

GitHub Copilot: # Insertion Sort List

This is a C program that implements the insertion sort algorithm on a doubly linked list.

## Code Overview

GitHub Copilot: # Selection Sort Algorithm

This repository includes a C implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.

## Overview of the Code

The provided code is a function that performs selection sort on an integer array. Selection sort is a simple, in-place sorting algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the ordering) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region. This process continues until the unsorted region becomes empty and the sorted region covers the entire input.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `i` and `j`: Loop counters.
- `small`: Index of the smallest element in the unsorted region.
- `temp`: A temporary variable used for swapping elements.
- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.

## Next Steps

- Enhance the efficiency of the sorting algorithm.
- Incorporate error handling for edge cases.
- Develop user-friendly input and output methods.

GitHub Copilot: # Quick Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a C implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs quick sort on an integer array. Quick sort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `init` and `end`: Indicate the start and end of the array or sub-array.
- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.

The `quick_sort` function is the main function that calls the `quick` function, which performs the actual sorting. The `Lomuto_part` function is used to partition the array around the pivot.

## Next Steps

- Improve the efficiency of the sorting algorithm.
- Add error handling for edge cases.
- Implement user-friendly input and output methods.

GitHub Copilot: # Shell Sort Algorithm

This repository includes a C implementation of the Shell Sort algorithm.

## Overview of the Code

The provided code is a function that performs shell sort on an integer array. Shell Sort is a generalized version of insertion sort. It first sorts elements far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be compared. The interval between the elements is gradually decreased based on the sequence used. In this implementation, the sequence is calculated using the formula `h = h * 3 + 1`.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `n`: The size of the array.
- `h`: The interval or gap between the elements to be compared.
- `i`, `j`, `k`: Loop counters.
- `temp`: A temporary variable used for swapping elements.
- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.

GitHub Copilot: # Cocktail Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a C implementation of the Cocktail Sort algorithm.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs cocktail sort on a doubly linked list. Cocktail Sort, also known as Bidirectional Bubble Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Shaker Sort, Ripple Sort, Shuffle Sort, or Shuttle Sort, is a variation of Bubble Sort. It differs in that instead of repeatedly passing through the list from bottom to top, it passes alternately from bottom to top and then from top to bottom.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `ptr`: A pointer used to traverse the list.
- `prev`: Points to the node before the current node.
- `prev_prev`: Points to the node before the `prev` node.
- `next`: Points to the node after the current node.
- `list`: The list to be sorted.

The `swap_nodes` function is used to swap two nodes in the list.

## Next Steps

- Improve the efficiency of the sorting algorithm.
- Add error handling for edge cases.
- Implement user-friendly input and output methods.
GitHub Copilot: # Counting Sort Algorithm

This repository includes a C implementation of the Counting Sort algorithm.

## Overview of the Code

The provided code is a function that performs counting sort on an integer array. Counting Sort is an integer sorting algorithm that sorts elements based on the count of individual elements. It is not a comparison-based sort and scales well for larger ranges of integer keys.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `n`: The size of the array.
- `i`, `j`: Loop counters.
- `max`: The maximum element in the array.
- `count_array`: An array to store the count of individual elements.
- `temp`: A temporary array to store the sorted elements.
- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.

The function first finds the maximum element in the array to determine the range of counts. It then allocates the `count_array` and `temp` arrays. If the allocation fails, it frees any previously allocated memory and returns.
GitHub Copilot: # Merge Sort Algorithm


## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs merge sort on an integer array. Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, comparison-based sorting algorithm most commonly used for sorting large data sets or lists. It is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by dividing the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), and repeatedly merging sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.
- `n`: The size of the array, cast to an integer.
- `init`: The starting index of the array or sub-array.
- `end`: The ending index of the array or sub-array.
- `m`: The middle index of the array or sub-array.

The `merge_sort` function is the main function that calls the `real_merge` function, which performs the actual sorting. The `real_merge` function recursively divides the array into two halves until it can no more be divided, then merges the smaller units back into larger units while performing the sorting.

GitHub Copilot: # Heap Sort Algorithm

This repository includes a C implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs heap sort on an integer array. Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement from selection sort is to use a heap to speed up finding the maximum.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.
- `init`: The starting index of the array or sub-array.
- `end`: The ending index of the array or sub-array.
- `a`, `b`: Indices used to traverse the array.
- `large`: Index of the largest element in the heap.
- `temp`: A temporary variable used for swapping elements.

The `hipify` function is used to rearrange the array into a heap. It compares the parent node with its children and swaps them if the parent node is smaller than the child node. This process is repeated until the entire array is transformed into a heap.

GitHub Copilot: # Radix Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a C implementation of the Radix Sort algorithm.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs radix sort on an integer array. Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. The sorting process starts from the least significant digit and moves towards the most significant digit.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.
- `digit`: The digit position being sorted.
- `n`: The size of the array, cast to an integer.
- `i`, `j`, `m`: Loop counters.
- `max`: The maximum element in the array.
- `count_array`: An array to store the count of individual elements.
- `temp`: A temporary array to store the sorted elements.

The `digit_count_sort` function is used to perform counting sort on each digit. It first finds the maximum element in the array to determine the range of counts. It then allocates the `count_array` and `temp` arrays. If the allocation fails, it frees any previously allocated memory and returns.

GitHub Copilot: # Bitonic Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a C implementation of the Bitonic Sort algorithm.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs bitonic sort on an integer array. Bitonic Sort is a parallel, comparison-based sorting algorithm which focuses on converting a random sequence of numbers into a bitonic sequence, one that monotonically increases, then decreases. Sequences that only increase or decrease can be considered bitonic as well.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.
- `init`: The starting index of the array or sub-array.
- `end`: The ending index of the array or sub-array.
- `dir`: The direction of sorting, true for ascending and false for descending.
- `mid`: The middle index of the array or sub-array.
- `i`: Loop counter.
- `temp`: A temporary variable used for swapping elements.

The `bitonic_merge` function is used to merge two bitonic sequences. It first checks if the sequence is longer than one element. If it is, it compares each element in the first half of the sequence with the corresponding element in the second half, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated recursively for both halves until the entire sequence is sorted.

GitHub Copilot: # Quick Sort Hoare Partition Scheme Algorithm

This repository contains a C implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm using the Hoare partition scheme.

## Code Overview

The provided code is a function that performs quick sort on an integer array. Quick Sort is an efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy. The Hoare partition scheme is an alternative to the Lomuto partition scheme and was developed by the inventor of Quick Sort, C.A.R. Hoare.

Here's a brief explanation of the variables used:

- `array`: The array to be sorted.
- `size`: The size of the array.
- `init`: The starting index of the array or sub-array.
- `end`: The ending index of the array or sub-array.
- `pos`: The position of the pivot element after partitioning.

The `quick_sort_hoare` function is the main function that calls the `quick` function, which performs the actual sorting. The `Hoare_part` function is used to partition the array around the pivot.

## Next Steps

- Improve the efficiency of the sorting algorithm.
- Add error handling for edge cases.
- Implement user-friendly input and output methods.
